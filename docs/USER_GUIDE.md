## 💡 Tips for Best Experience

### Audio Setup
1. **Use headphones** for binaural beats (sub-80Hz frequencies)
2. **Quality matters** - Good headphones improve healing effect
3. **Comfortable volume** - Not too loud, just clearly audible

### Session Best Practices
1. **Find a quiet space** - Minimize distractions
2. **Set intention first** - Know what you're healing/achieving
3. **Consistency > Duration** - 15 min daily beats 2 hours weekly
4. **Combine with breathing** - Deep breaths amplify effects

### Creating Effective Custom Baths
1. **Start simple** - 2-3 layers before adding more
2. **Complementary frequencies** - Combine related categories
3. **Base + Enhancement** - Use a grounding frequency + targeted ones
4. **Example Stack:**
   - Layer 1: 528Hz (Love/Healing) - Base
   - Layer 2: 741Hz (Intuition) - Enhancement
   - Layer 3: 10Hz Alpha (Focus) - Brainwave support

### Manifestation Success
1. **Be specific** - "Earn $10,000 by March" vs. "More money"
2. **Feel the emotion** - Visualize achievement during sessions
3. **Daily practice** - Even 5 minutes maintains momentum
4. **Track progress** - Use the journal to see patterns

### Troubleshooting
- **No sound?** - Check device volume, try headphones
- **Frequencies feel off?** - Start with lower volume, shorter sessions
- **Custom bath won't save?** - Ensure at least 1 layer added
- **Favorites not showing?** - Pull down to refresh
